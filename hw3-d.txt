My experience using the Azure DBMS cloud service was at first complicated but very awesome
the long term benefits of employing such a technology is very important. As with any new
technology mos of the difficulty was in setting up the database as well as becoming familiar
with the Azure interface. For example, I had some original difficulties uploading the Flights
database to the Azure database and it was simply due to a lack of understanding of the Azure
interface. Additionally, there were some difficulties in configuring it with my specific IDE
(VSCode) but those were personal difficulties. The benefits are great such as being able to
afford the use of world-class database technologies as well as not having to deal with so much
of the database management/hardware side of writing code. I am very excited I got to work with
this cloud service because I know it is huge in industry and the safekeeping of records in the
cloud is also very underrated.

Advantages:
- Afford world-class database hardware.
- Only pay for as much storage and compute power as you use.
- Do not need to worry about maintaining, deploying, and servicing your database systems.
- Information is securely stored in cloud and not having in-house data storage means
  you are not risking physical damage to your databases.
- Cloud compute allows the burden of compute to be on cloud comput rather than local computer.
- You can access the database from anywhere instead of having to be connected to it locally.

Disadvantages:
- As with any technologies there are difficulties in learning the Azure interface as well
  as how the database works.
- You must have a network connection to interact with a cloud-based DBMS.
- Although security is a strong-suit of cloud technology these days it is always a risk to
  house information on the internet.
- A vulnerability in the Azure service means there is a vulnerability in your own data.
